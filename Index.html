        <p>
            I never got your number<br>
            Am I reading into your smile?<br>
            Or am I reading between your lips?,<br>
            Was that a spark? Am I imagining this?<br>
            <br>
            Maybe you got somewhere to be<br>
            And I'm afraid of what the answer will be<br>
            So instead, I watch you leave<br>
            <br>
            Maybe my soulmate died, I don't know<br>
            Maybe I don't have a soul<br>
            What if I saw you on the train last night and I just walked on by?<br>
            What if I never let you in?<br>
            And now you're with somebody who did<br>
            All of this miscommunication, indecisiveness, be patient<br>
        </p>
